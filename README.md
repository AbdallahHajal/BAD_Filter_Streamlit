## Brief Description
The BAD Molecule Filter is a machine learning tool specifically developed to revolutionize drug discovery by precisely identifying Small Colloidally Aggregating Molecules (SCAMs). Utilizing state-of-the-art Decision Tree Ensemble Methods, this tool improves the accuracy of SCAM detection. This tool plays a vital role in significantly enhancing the efficiency of hit rate optimization while concurrently minimizing the time and resources spent on testing and validation in the critical early stages of drug discovery.
