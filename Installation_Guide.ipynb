    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Installing Python and Activate Virtual Environment (if applicable) \n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows/OSX: \n",
    "\n",
    "Install Latest Python Version [From Link](https://www.python.org/downloads/) \n",
    "You can also run provided python.bat on windows \n",
    "\n",
    "On Linux:\n",
    "\n",
    "Install relavent package  [From Link](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  or through app manager on \n",
    "\n",
    "terminal as :\n",
    "\n",
    "apt or rpm \n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "#ubuntu based distro\n",
    "apt install python3 \n",
    "#redhat based distro\n",
    "rpm install python3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then change to downloaded file directory (using Command Prompt or Terminal) and run commands\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "python -m venv venv\n",
    "source venv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Step 2: Install Required Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "python -m pip install flask werkzeug numpy pandas rdkit mordred scikit-learn pyADA`\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Step 3: Optional - Freeze Dependencies to requirements.txt in Case of Changes to Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a requirements.txt file with the versions of the installed packages. Now, the file should contain lines similar to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Flask==1.1.2\n",
    "Werkzeug==1.0.1\n",
    "numpy==1.20.2\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Install from requirements.txt\n",
    "To install these dependencies in another environment, use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will install the specified versions of the packages listed in the requirements.txt file.\n",
    "\n",

    "```console\n",
    "source /path/to/your/venv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Run Flask in Development Mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "export FLASK_APP=app\n",
    "export FLASK_ENV=development\n",
    "flask run\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The FLASK_APP environment variable is set to the name of Flask application (without the \".py\" extension).\n",
    "Note: The FLASK_ENV environment variable is set to \"development\" to enable debug mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Access the Application:\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a web browser and go to **http://127.0.0.1:5000/** to access your Flask application.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stop the Development Server:\n",
    "Press Ctrl+C in the terminal where the Flask application is running to stop the development server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install Production Web Server (e.g., gunicorn):\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "pip install gunicorn`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Run Flask with Gunicorn:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app`\n",
    "```\n",
    "-w 4 specifies the number of worker processes. Adjust it based on your server's capabilities.\n",
    "-b 0.0.0.0:8000 binds Gunicorn to all public IPs on port 8000.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Access the Application:\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a web browser and go to http://your-server-ip:8000/ to access your Flask application.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stop Gunicorn:\n",
    "\n",
    "To stop Gunicorn, you can find its process ID using tools like ps or pgrep and then use kill to stop the process in Linux/Unix/OSX or through task manager Ctrl+Alt+Del in Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "ps aux | grep gunicorn\n",
    "kill -9 <process_id>\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note: Ensure to adjust the server configuration (e.g., number of workers) based on your deployment requirements.\n",
